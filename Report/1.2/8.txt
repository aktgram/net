Socket Programming system calls in c

1. Socket Creation
Eg: int sockfd = socket(domain, type, protocol)

sockfd: socket descriptor, an integer (like a file-handle)
domain: Integer that specifies communication domain

type: communication type, 
        Eg:-
        SOCK_STREAM: TCP(reliable, connection oriented)
        SOCK_DGRAM: UDP(unreliable, connectionless)

protocol: Protocol value for Internet Protocol(IP), which is 0.


2. Binding
Eg: bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen)

After creation of the socket, bind function binds the socket to the address and port number 
specified in addr


3. Accept
Eg: new_socket= accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen)

It extracts the first connection request on the queue of pending connections for the listening 
socket, sockfd, creates a new connected socket, and returns a new file descriptor referring to 
that socket. This establishes a connection between two nodes.


4. Connection
Eg: connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen)

The connect() system call connects the socket referred to by the file descriptor sockfd to the 
address specified by addr. Server address and port is specified in addr.
